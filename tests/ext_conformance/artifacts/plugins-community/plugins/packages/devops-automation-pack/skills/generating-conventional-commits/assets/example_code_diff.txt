# Example Code Diff for Commit Message Generation

This document provides an example code diff that can be used by the `devops-automation-pack` plugin to generate commit messages.  The `example_code_diff.txt` file should contain the raw diff output. This file is used as input for plugins like `generate_commit_message` within the `devops-automation-pack`.

## Purpose

The purpose of this file is to provide a clear and concise example of a code diff, which the `generate_commit_message` plugin uses to create informative and helpful commit messages.  This helps developers write better commit messages, improving code maintainability and collaboration.

## File Contents (example_code_diff.txt)

```
--- a/example.py
+++ b/example.py
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
 def hello_world():
-    print("Hello, world!")
+    message = "Hello, world!"
+    print(message)
 
 hello_world()

```

## Explanation

The above diff shows a simple change to the `example.py` file.  Specifically, it shows:

*   **`--- a/example.py`**:  Indicates the original file (`example.py`) before the changes.
*   **`+++ b/example.py`**:  Indicates the modified file (`example.py`) after the changes.
*   **`@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@`**:  Indicates the line numbers that were changed.  `-1,4` means lines 1 through 4 in the original file. `+1,5` means lines 1 through 5 in the modified file.
*   **`-    print("Hello, world!")`**:  The line that was removed (indicated by the `-`).
*   **`+    message = "Hello, world!"`**: The first line added (indicated by the `+`).
*   **`+    print(message)`**:  The second line added (indicated by the `+`).

## How to Use This File

1.  **Replace the contents:**  Replace the contents of the `example_code_diff.txt` file with a real code diff that you want to use to generate a commit message. You can obtain this diff using `git diff` or a similar tool.
2.  **Integrate with the plugin:** Refer to the `devops-automation-pack` plugin documentation for instructions on how to use this file as input for the `generate_commit_message` plugin (or similar plugins that utilize diffs). The plugin will typically read the content of this file and use it to intelligently generate a suggested commit message.

## Example Plugin Usage (Conceptual)

```
# Example Python code demonstrating how the plugin might use the diff file
# (This is an illustrative example and might not be the exact API)

from devops_automation_pack import generate_commit_message

with open("example_code_diff.txt", "r") as f:
  code_diff = f.read()

commit_message = generate_commit_message(code_diff)
print(commit_message)
```

## Best Practices

*   **Ensure the diff is clean:**  Make sure the diff is free of merge conflicts or other extraneous information. A clean diff will result in a better commit message.
*   **Review the generated message:** Always review the generated commit message before committing the changes.  The AI-generated message is a suggestion, and you should always ensure it accurately reflects the changes made.
*   **Use descriptive diffs:** The more descriptive the diff, the better the AI will be able to understand the changes and generate a relevant commit message.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Plugin not generating a message:**  Double-check that the `example_code_diff.txt` file exists and contains valid diff output.
*   **Poor quality message:**  Try simplifying the diff or providing additional context to the plugin (if the plugin supports it).  Also, remember to always review and edit the generated message.
