# Extension Platform Program Governance

This document defines ownership, decision authority, quality gates, and
maintenance cadence for the Pi extension platform.

---

## Ownership

| Area | Owner | Backup |
|------|-------|--------|
| Runtime (PiJS, QuickJS, hostcalls) | Primary maintainer | AI agent review (Claude/Codex) |
| Extension API surface | Primary maintainer | AI agent review |
| Capability policy (safe/balanced/permissive) | Primary maintainer | Security review required |
| CI/CD pipelines | Primary maintainer | Self-healing via gate promotion |
| Conformance corpus (223 extensions) | Automated via conformance harness | Manual triage for new failures |
| Documentation | Primary maintainer + agents | Automated staleness checks |
| Sibling crates (asupersync, rich_rust, charmed, sqlmodel) | Independently versioned | Cross-repo coordination via bead dependencies |

### Decision Authority

- **Breaking changes** to extension API: Primary maintainer approval required.
  Documented in CHANGELOG.md before release.
- **Capability policy changes** (adding/removing capabilities): Requires
  security review and conformance regression check.
- **New official extensions**: Must pass conformance at Tier 1-2 level with
  clean preflight report.
- **Dependency additions**: Must pass `cargo audit`, no `unsafe` in new deps.

## Quality Gates

### CI Gates (Enforced on Every PR)

| Gate | Threshold | Enforcement |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `cargo fmt` | Zero diff | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| `cargo clippy -D warnings` | Zero warnings | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Unit tests | 100% pass | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| VCR/fixture tests | 100% pass | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| No-mock dependency guard | Zero violations | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Suite classification guard | All files classified | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| Traceability matrix guard | All classified tests traced | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| VCR leak guard | No cassettes in wrong suite | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| PR Definition-of-Done evidence guard | Required for feature-surface PRs | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

### Conformance Gates (Nightly + Release)

| Gate | Threshold | Source |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Extension corpus pass rate | >= 80% (current: 91.9%) | `conformance_summary.json` |
| Scenario conformance | >= 90% (current: 96.0%) | `scenario_conformance.json` |
| Node API matrix | 100% critical pass (current: 13/13) | `runtime_api_matrix.json` |
| Maximum failures | <= 36 extensions | `conformance_summary.json` |
| Maximum N/A | <= 170 extensions | `conformance_summary.json` |
| Policy negative tests | 100% pass | `conformance_report.json` |

### Performance Gates

| Budget | Threshold | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Cold extension load | < 200ms p95 | `budget_summary.json` |
| Warm extension load | < 50ms p95 | `budget_summary.json` |
| Event dispatch latency | < 10ms p95 | `budget_summary.json` |
| Binary size | < 50MB | CI artifact check |

See [BENCHMARKS.md](../BENCHMARKS.md) for full budget definitions.

### Release Gates (1.0 Criteria)

Per [releasing.md](releasing.md):
- CI green on Linux/macOS/Windows
- Core CLI modes stable (print + interactive + RPC)
- Extension runtime surface and security policy stable
- Conformance gates met at release thresholds

### Definition of Done for Feature Changes

Feature-surface PRs (runtime/provider/tooling behavior changes) are not mergeable until:

1. PR body includes checked evidence for unit, e2e, and extension validation.
2. PR body links directly to structured artifacts/logs for those runs.
3. PR body includes reproduction commands for both passing validation and the most recent failing path.
4. PR body contains no unresolved checklist placeholders.

The canonical checklist source is `.github/pull_request_template.md`, and CI enforces it in
the Linux PR lane.

#### Migration Guidance for Existing Feature Branches

1. Rebase on latest `main`.
2. Replace PR body with `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
3. Backfill evidence links from latest CI/local runs.
4. Include explicit failing-path artifact links plus exact rerun commands.
5. Re-run CI and merge only after DoD guard passes.

## Release Cadence

| Channel | Frequency | Scope |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Patch (`0.x.Y`) | As needed | Bug fixes, conformance improvements |
| Minor (`0.X.0`) | Monthly | New features, API additions |
| Major (`X.0.0`) | When 1.0 criteria met | Stability commitment |
| Pre-release (`-rc.N`) | Before major/minor | Validation window |

### Versioning Rules

- **SemVer** with tag format `vX.Y.Z` (source of truth: `Cargo.toml`).
- Pre-1.0: breaking changes allowed with changelog documentation.
- Post-1.0: breaking changes require major version bump and deprecation window.
- Sibling crates versioned independently.

See [releasing.md](releasing.md) for the full release process.

## Maintenance Cadence

### Weekly

| Task | Owner | Verification |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Dependency audit (`cargo audit`) | Automated | CI gate |
| Conformance regression review | Agent triage | Nightly CI reports |
| Bead backlog grooming | Primary maintainer | `bv --robot-triage` |

### Monthly

| Task | Owner | Verification |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Performance budget review | Primary maintainer | `budget_summary.json` trends |
| Extension corpus update | Automated discovery | `extension-inclusion-list.json` |
| Documentation staleness check | Traceability tests | `traceability_staleness.rs` |
| CI gate threshold review | Primary maintainer | Gate promotion workflow |

### Quarterly

| Task | Owner | Verification |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Full conformance campaign (223 extensions) | Automated | `conformance.yml` nightly |
| Security review of capability policies | Primary maintainer | Threat model doc |
| Dependency major version updates | Primary maintainer | `cargo update` + full test |
| Roadmap review and bead reprioritization | Primary maintainer | `bv --robot-triage` |

## Extension Governance

### Tiers and Vetting

| Tier | Count | Vetting | Conformance |
|------|------:|---------|-------------|
| Official | 60 | Full review, MIT license verified | 100% pass required |
| Community | 58 | Automated conformance check | 90%+ pass target |
| npm registry | 66 | License + provenance check | Best-effort |
| Third-party | 23 | Provenance verification | Best-effort |
| Agent ecosystem | 1+ | Same as community | Same as community |

### Adding New Extensions

1. Extension passes `pi doctor` with PASS verdict.
2. License is permissive (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD).
3. Provenance is pinnable (git commit hash or npm version).
4. No per-extension patches required (unmodified compatibility).
5. Added to `docs/extension-inclusion-list.json` with tier assignment.

### Removing Extensions

- Extensions are removed from the corpus when:
  - License changes to incompatible terms.
  - Source becomes unavailable (unpinnable provenance).
  - Extension requires per-extension patches to function.
- Removal is documented in CHANGELOG.md.

---

## Deprecation Policy

### Pre-1.0 (Current)

- Breaking changes are allowed with CHANGELOG documentation.
- Deprecated APIs emit runtime warnings for at least one minor release.
- CLI flag changes are documented in `--help` output.

### Post-1.0 (Future)

- Deprecated APIs: warning for 2 minor releases, removal in next major.
- CLI flag removal: 1 minor release deprecation window.
- Extension API changes: 2 minor release deprecation window.
- Capability policy changes: announced in release notes.

---

## Incident Response

### Conformance Regression on Main

1. Triage within 24 hours via `bv --robot-triage`.
2. If regression is in runtime: fix and cut patch release.
3. If regression is in test harness: fix harness, re-run campaign.
4. If regression is in extension: update exception list with justification.

### Security Vulnerability

1. Assess severity (capability escape, sandbox bypass, data leak).
2. Critical/High: fix within 48 hours, cut patch release.
3. Medium/Low: fix in next scheduled release.
4. Document in CHANGELOG.md and release notes.

### Performance Regression

1. Compare against baseline in `budget_summary.json`.
2. If budget exceeded by >20%: investigate and fix before release.
3. If budget exceeded by <20%: document and adjust threshold if justified.
